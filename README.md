#Primes Challenge

###Objective
* Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime
numbers.
* The program must run from the command line and print one table to
STDOUT.
* The first row and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with each cell containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and column.

###Notes
• Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale?
• Consider cases where we want N primes.
• Do not use the Prime class from stdlib (write your own code).
• Write tests. Try to demonstrate TDD/BDD.

###Approach

####Primes Class
* Create a Primes class that is going to instantiate 'n' number of primes

####Compute Primes Multiplication
* Compute the value of multiplied primes

####Display the Multiplication Table
* Has methods to display and print the table to the commandline

#What I need:

-Get 10 prime numbers
-Compute the value of the multiplication of each prime combo
-Display the table
